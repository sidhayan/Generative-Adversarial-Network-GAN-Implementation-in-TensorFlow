# Generative-Adversarial-Network-GAN-Implementation-in-TensorFlow
I've just implemented a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow. GANs are a fascinating class of machine learning models that consist of a generator and a discriminator trained adversarially. The generator creates synthetic data, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data.
